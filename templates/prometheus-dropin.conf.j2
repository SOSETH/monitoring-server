You can use cgroups, Docker limits, etc. to limit memory usage if you
wish.

However the memory model is very different in v2 - OS memory caching is
used for much of what was previously managed by Prometheus itself, so
you are better off allowing it to take what it needs, knowing the OS
will throw things away (with no functional impact) if the memory is
needed.

As before if you try to do a query that needs lots of memory, or you try
to scrape lots of metrics you may use up all your RAM causing Prometheus
to crash.
-> Prometheus as a database has no memory limit. However, the go runtime will
   detect ulimit, so we set that here if desired and hope for the best.
